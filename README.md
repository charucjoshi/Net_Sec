# Documentation for implementing SSL, SSH and SCP using OpenSSL and OpenSSH. 

# SSL/TLS
## X.509 certificates are used. 
## The Certificate Authority(CA) and servers are on different systems making the implementation more real-world instead of using self-signed certificates.

# SSH/SCP
## Used OpenSSH for these.
